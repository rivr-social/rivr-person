/**
 * @module lib/stripe-mode
 *
 * Test/live mode binding for inbound Stripe events.
 *
 * A correctly signed event whose `livemode` disagrees with this instance's keys
 * came from an endpoint pointed at the wrong instance. Processing it is silent
 * and dangerous in both directions: a test event settled here would credit the
 * owner's real wallet balance from play money, and a live event landing on a
 * test instance would record real buyer money as test data.
 *
 * This is the sovereign counterpart of global's `lib/stripe-mode.ts`. It derives
 * the mode from the secret key prefix rather than global's fail-closed
 * `validateStripeOperationalConfiguration`, because sovereign instances do not
 * carry that validation — Global is the sole Stripe platform, and local capture
 * is being retired. Deliberately NOT a manifest-shared contract file: the two
 * implementations answer the same question from different sources.

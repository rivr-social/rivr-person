/**
 * Federation event export API route.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Queues and returns exportable federation events for the authenticated local node.
 *
 * Key exports:
 * - `POST`: Initiates export queueing and emits a batch of exportable events.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - `authorizeFederationRequest` for federation request authentication.
 * - `ensureLocalNode` for local node context.
 * - `queueExportEvents`, `listExportableEvents`, and `markEventsExported` for export workflow orchestration.
 * - HTTP status constants from `@/lib/http-status`.

/**
 * Queues and exports federation events based on optional visibility/scope filters.
 *
 * Auth requirements:
 * - Requires valid federation authorization. Unauthorized requests return `401`.
 *
 * Rate limiting:
 * - No route-level limiter is enforced here; platform- or middleware-level controls
 *   should be used if request throttling is required.
 *
 * Error handling pattern:
 * - Invalid/missing JSON body is tolerated because the payload is optional.
 * - Authentication failures return explicit JSON errors and status codes.
 * - Service-level failures are allowed to propagate to global error handling.
 *
 * Business rules:
 * - After selecting exportable events, they are marked as exported in the same request flow.
 *
 * @param {NextRequest} request - Incoming HTTP request with optional export constraints.
 * @returns {Promise<NextResponse>} JSON response containing queue count and exported event payloads.
 * @throws {Error} Propagates unexpected federation service failures.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const req = new Request("https://example.com/api/federation/events/export", {
 *   method: "POST",
 *   body: JSON.stringify({ targetNodeSlug: "peer-a", limit: 100 }),
 * });
 * const response = await POST(req as NextRequest);
 * ```
